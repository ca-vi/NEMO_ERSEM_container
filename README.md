# NEMO-container

Repo containing instruction for creating a [singularity container](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html) for NEMO-ERSEM. The setup is based heavily apon the [CoNES repo](https://github.com/NOC-MSM/CoNES) .

## Getting started

The NEMO-ERSEM container utilises [Singularity Deploy](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-deploy) which builds the container via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically create the container to download.
